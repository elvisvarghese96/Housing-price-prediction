# Housing-price-prediction model

This project involves building a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features. The aim is to provide an accurate estimate of house prices to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

Project Overview
The Housing Price Prediction model leverages historical data and various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other relevant factors to predict the market value of a house. The model aims to provide accurate and reliable price estimates by analyzing these features.

Features worked on:-
Data Preprocessing: 
 - Handling missing values
 - Encoding categorical variables
 - Scaling numerical features
   
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 - Visualizing data distributions
 - Relationships between features and target variables.

Model Training: Linear Regression.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Feature Importance
Analyzing the importance of different features in predicting house prices.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features that influence house prices. The data is sourced from Kaggle and is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
